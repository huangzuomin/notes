# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to create an interactive single-page web application that visualizes a 12-day Northern Xinjiang self-driving tour itinerary using Gaode Maps (高德地图). The application will transform the detailed travel itinerary into an intuitive, interactive map experience that allows users to explore daily routes, view location details, and understand the travel arrangement through geographic visualization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a traveler planning a Xinjiang trip, I want to view the complete 12-day itinerary on an interactive map, so that I can understand the geographic layout and route progression of the entire journey.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a Gaode Maps interface with all 12 days of travel locations marked
2. WHEN the user views the map THEN the system SHALL show the complete Northern Xinjiang loop route from Urumqi
3. WHEN all locations are displayed THEN the system SHALL use different marker styles for different location types (hotels, attractions, restaurants)
4. WHEN the map initializes THEN the system SHALL set the view to encompass the entire travel route

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user exploring the itinerary, I want to filter the map by specific days, so that I can focus on individual daily routes and activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on a specific day in the sidebar THEN the system SHALL display only that day's locations and route on the map
2. WHEN a day is selected THEN the system SHALL highlight the selected day in the sidebar interface
3. WHEN switching between days THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition the map view to fit the selected day's route
4. WHEN no day is selected THEN the system SHALL display all days' information simultaneously

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user interested in specific locations, I want to click on map markers to see detailed information, so that I can learn about each destination, accommodation, and activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on a location marker THEN the system SHALL display an information window with location details
2. WHEN the information window opens THEN the system SHALL show location name, address, activity description, and relevant notes
3. WHEN multiple markers are close together THEN the system SHALL ensure information windows are clearly readable and non-overlapping
4. WHEN the user clicks elsewhere on the map THEN the system SHALL close any open information windows

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user planning travel logistics, I want to see driving routes between locations, so that I can understand the travel distances and route connections for each day.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying a day's itinerary THEN the system SHALL show driving routes connecting all locations in chronological order
2. WHEN routes are displayed THEN the system SHALL use the Gaode Maps Driving API to calculate realistic driving paths
3. WHEN routes are shown THEN the system SHALL display different colored lines for different days
4. WHEN switching between days THEN the system SHALL clear previous routes before displaying new ones

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user browsing the itinerary, I want the sidebar list to interact with the map markers, so that I can easily correlate written information with geographic locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user hovers over a location in the sidebar THEN the system SHALL highlight the corresponding marker on the map
2. WHEN the user clicks on a location in the sidebar THEN the system SHALL center the map on that location and open its information window
3. WHEN the sidebar shows daily itineraries THEN the system SHALL organize information chronologically by day
4. WHEN displaying location information THEN the system SHALL include key details like accommodation names, attraction descriptions, and travel notes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user accessing the application on different devices, I want the interface to be responsive, so that I can use the map effectively on both desktop and mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout to show the sidebar and map appropriately
2. WHEN on small screens THEN the system SHALL allow the sidebar to be collapsible or repositioned
3. WHEN the interface adapts THEN the system SHALL ensure no horizontal scrolling is required
4. WHEN touch interactions are used THEN the system SHALL support standard map gestures like pinch-to-zoom and pan

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user interested in travel statistics, I want to see visual summaries of the trip data, so that I can understand the scope and scale of the journey.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application displays trip information THEN the system SHALL show total distance, number of days, and key destinations
2. WHEN statistical information is shown THEN the system SHALL use charts or visual elements to represent data like daily driving distances
3. WHEN budget information is available THEN the system SHALL display cost breakdowns in an accessible format
4. WHEN displaying statistics THEN the system SHALL ensure the information complements rather than clutters the map interface

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user planning to use this application, I want clear instructions for setting up the Gaode Maps API, so that I can successfully run the application with my own API key.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application code is provided THEN the system SHALL include a clear placeholder for the Gaode Maps API key
2. WHEN API integration is implemented THEN the system SHALL include proper error handling for missing or invalid API keys
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback if the API key is not configured
4. WHEN documentation is provided THEN the system SHALL include instructions for obtaining and configuring a Gaode Maps API key
